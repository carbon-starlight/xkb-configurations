These are my xkb configs that I believe might be useful to other people

Among layouts that are not avalible in standard xkb it has Diktor, Rulemak _(it is in standard xkb but is missing from some evdev.xml configs that are on part of the OS)_ and powerful [Extend](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html) layers for them (and colemak).
